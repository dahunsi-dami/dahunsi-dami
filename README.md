# ♮ Damilare 'Dahunsi

**`Software engineer (ex-full time musician)`**

I recently completed the ALX Africa Software Engineering program, *powered by Holberton Inc.*, where I built some projects. I enjoy programming and exploring how software intersects with other fields like finance, healthcare, and education.
