## Hi there 👋

I'm Damilare, a software engineer from Nigeria. I recently completed the ALX Africa Software Engineering program (powered by Holberton Inc.), where I built many projects. I enjoy programming and exploring how software intersects with other fields like finance, healthcare, and education. You can check me out on 𝕏 at x.com/thedahunsidavid or linkedin.com/in/ogundahunsi-damilare/.
